  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Hi, I am Cienna!</em></p>
  <p>I’m currently 19 years old. My friends call me “Cienna” or sometimes just “Cien”. I graduated SHS here in Asia Pacific College. During my free time, I usually watch American movies and tv series. I live with my family at Pasay City. My family is composed of four people; my mom, my dad, and my sister. I am the youngest member of our family. Being the youngest is the best part of having a sibling. My sister and mom would always give me what I want even if sometimes I feel that I don’t deserve it. Aside from having different sets of friends and best friends, my sister is also one of my best friends. We both love to travel. We’ve been in different places around here in the Philippines. She would always take the expenses and let me enjoy the things that I didn’t expect to experience like buying me concert tickets, buying me clothes, and even gadgets. We also love to stroll and explore the different type of foods. She always has time for us to bond and satisfy my taste buds. I always love hanging out with her because it’s the time that I got to know her.</p>

      <p>I always got excited when travelling especially when at the beach. I always feel that there’s part of me that I didn’t know and somehow, little by little I got to know what it is. I feel so relaxed when the water splashes into my body. I enjoy travelling with the people who are close in my heart, but someday I wish I could travel alone just for an experience. Keeping my friends are the best decision that I’ve made because they never let me feel that I’m alone. I always feel loved by them even though some of them are away.</p>
